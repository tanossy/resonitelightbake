// Unity AudioReverbFilter (+ optional AudioEchoFilter) -> Resonite AudioZitaReverb
// ============================================================================================
//
// IMPORTANT / UNVERIFIED (read before touching numbers below):
//  - This converter has NOT been verified against a running Resonite client (Resonite was
//    offline at the time this was written). Compilation correctness and the *logic* of the
//    approximations below have been checked as carefully as possible, but the actual in-world
//    audible result, and even whether AudioZitaReverb works at all when attached standalone to
//    the same Slot as an AudioOutput (i.e. without being routed through an AudioListener /
//    spatial reverb zone the way the only known working sample uses it), is UNCONFIRMED.
//  - Resonite only exposes a single DSP effect component for this purpose: AudioZitaReverb.
//    There is no Resonite equivalent for a low-pass/high-pass/distortion/chorus/compressor/
//    plain-delay-echo filter, and the legacy AudioReverbZone is explicitly documented as only
//    working on non-spatialized audio, so it is intentionally not used here.
//  - AudioZitaReverb's field names (InDelay/Crossover/RT60Low/RT60Mid/HighFrequencyDamping/
//    EQ1Frequency/EQ1Level/EQ2Frequency/EQ2Level/Mix/Level) line up 1:1 with the well-known
//    open-source "Zita-Rev1" reverb algorithm by Fons Adriaensen (delay/xover/rtlow/rtmid/
//    fdamp/eq1/eq2/mix/level), which strongly suggests Resonite's component is a wrapper
//    around that exact algorithm. The mapping below leans on the *publicly documented*
//    semantics of that algorithm (delay=ms pre-delay, xover=Hz low/mid crossover, rtlow/
//    rtmid=seconds decay times per band, fdamp=Hz frequency above which decay shortens,
//    mix=0..1 dry/wet, level=dB output gain). This inference could not be double-checked
//    against Resonite's own source, so treat it as a well-reasoned best guess, not fact.
//
// UNITY SIDE - property meanings were confirmed by decompiling the exact
// UnityEngine.AudioModule.dll shipped with this project's Unity 2022.3.22f1 install
// (Editor/Data/Managed/UnityEngine/UnityEngine.AudioModule.dll), which carries Unity's own
// XML-doc comments compiled into the assembly. AudioReverbFilter mirrors the classic EAX/I3DL2
// reverb parameter set almost verbatim:
//   dryLevel          mB   -10000..0      default 0      dry (unprocessed) signal level
//   room              mB   -10000..0      default 0      overall/mid-band room (wet) level
//   roomHF            mB   -10000..0      default 0      room level attenuation at high freq
//   roomLF            mB   -10000..0      default 0      room level attenuation at low freq
//   decayTime         sec  0.1..20.0      default 1.0    doc string: "decay time AT LOW FREQUENCIES"
//   decayHFRatio      ratio 0.1..2.0      default 0.5    HF decay time relative to decayTime
//   reflectionsLevel  mB   -10000..1000   default -10000 early reflections level (no Zita eq.)
//   reflectionsDelay  sec  0.0..0.3       default 0.0    early reflections delay (no Zita eq.)
//   reverbLevel       mB   -10000..2000   default 0      late reverb level relative to room
//   reverbDelay       sec  0.0..0.1       default 0.04   late reverb delay rel. to direct sound
//   hfReference       Hz   1000..20000    default 5000   reference freq for decayHFRatio/roomHF
//   lfReference       Hz   20..1000       default 250    reference freq for roomLF
//   diffusion / density  %  0..100        (no Zita equivalent, echo density / modal density)
//   reverbPreset      enum (Off, Generic, ... , User)
//
//  NOTE ON reflectionsDelay's DOC STRING: the compiled XML doc for `reflectionsDelay` in this
//  DLL is textually IDENTICAL to `reverbLevel`'s doc ("Late reverberation level relative to
//  room effect in millibels (mB)..."), which is almost certainly a Unity documentation
//  copy/paste bug -- a property literally named "*Delay" being in millibels makes no sense,
//  and every other reverb SDK modeling the I3DL2 spec (which this 1:1 matches by name/range)
//  defines ReflectionsDelay as a TIME value in seconds. reflectionsDelay is treated as a
//  seconds value below (though ultimately unused, since Zita has no early-reflections stage).
//
//  NOTE ON PRESETS: when `reverbPreset != AudioReverbPreset.User`, Unity's native reverb filter
//  applies the preset's built-in parameter table internally. It is UNCONFIRMED whether reading
//  the individual properties (room/decayTime/etc.) back via the C# API returns the *resolved*
//  preset values or stale/default values that were never written back to the managed side, when
//  queried from an Editor (non-Play-mode) script such as this converter. A warning is logged in
//  that case so results can be spot-checked manually; if in doubt, set the preset to `User` in
//  the Inspector before conversion to guarantee the manual fields are what gets read.
//
//  RESONITE-SIDE PRESET INVESTIGATION:
//  Resonite's AudioZitaReverb exposes 25 "PresetXxx" members including `PresetUnderwater`
//  (matching Unity's `AudioReverbPreset.Underwater`), but every one of them is a runtime RPC
//  method, not a field. This was confirmed two independent ways:
//   1. The checked-in generated binding (BindingsGenerator/.../Generated/Audio/FrooxEngine/
//      AudioZitaReverbWrapper.cs), produced from a live ResoniteLink session against Resonite
//      2026.3.5.946, declares each preset as
//      `public async Task PresetUnderwater(IConversionContext context)` that builds a
//      `ResoniteLink.CallSyncMethod { MethodName = "PresetUnderwater" }` and awaits
//      `context.CallMethod(...)` - i.e. it fires a synced RPC on a live, already-spawned
//      object, and requires a connected session/TargetID.
//   2. `ilspycmd -t FrooxEngine.AudioZitaReverb` against the shipped
//      Assets/ResoniteSDK/Plugins/Resonite.UnitySDK.Bindings.dll independently decompiles to
//      the exact same shape: only 11 float Sync fields exist on the type at all (InDelay,
//      Crossover, RT60Low, RT60Mid, HighFrequencyDamping, EQ1Frequency, EQ1Level,
//      EQ2Frequency, EQ2Level, Mix, Level - the same 11 already used by SetFrom() above); no
//      enum/int/string field selecting a preset exists anywhere on the type.
//  Conclusion: Resonite's PresetUnderwater (and all other AudioZitaReverb presets) cannot be
//  applied statically at Editor conversion time - there is nothing to set on the component
//  data before the object is ever synced to a running Resonite session. This is a hard
//  platform limitation, not a gap in this converter; no field-based shortcut exists to wire
//  up here. If a future Resonite version adds a preset selector field, the correct place to
//  apply it would be right here in SetFrom(), gated on
//  `unityReverb.reverbPreset == AudioReverbPreset.Underwater`.
//  As a sanity check, Unity's own Underwater preset values were run through the numeric
//  mapping below and flow through it without any special-casing needed: decayTime=1.49 /
//  decayHFRatio=0.1 -> RT60Low=1.49s, RT60Mid=0.149s (a short, heavily damped high-frequency
//  tail, consistent with the "muffled" underwater sound); room=-1000mB / reverbLevel=1700mB ->
//  Level=(-1000+1700)/100=+7dB (a notably loud wet signal, again consistent with Underwater's
//  characteristically dense reverb). Every formula involved (Mathf.Pow, division,
//  Mathf.Clamp01/Mathf.Max) is well-defined for these inputs, so there's no divide-by-zero/
//  NaN/exception risk. This is a hand-checked arithmetic sanity check only, not an in-client
//  audible verification (see UNCONFIRMED notes above and in the class-level summary).

        // form) as a low frequency, typically tens to a few hundred Hz - the same range as

        // If this component really is Zita-Rev1, "fdamp" is a frequency (typically in the low
        // kHz..~20kHz range) above which the decay time is progressively shortened - i.e. it's

        // just expressed as a frequency threshold instead of a ratio. hfReference (1000..20000
        // Hz, default 5000) is the right range for this. decayHFRatio is folded in as a
        // multiplicative bias: ratio < 1 (treble decays faster/more "damped") pulls the damping
        // frequency down (damping kicks in earlier); ratio > 1 pushes it up (less damping,
        // brighter tail). ratio == 1 (no extra HF decay) leaves it at hfReference unchanged.
        // This is a heuristic, not a verified formula - there is no Resonite documentation to
        // confirm HighFrequencyDamping's units/range, so this assumes it behaves like Zita's
        // "fdamp" based purely on the field name and its position alongside Crossover/RT60*.

        // the main reverb tail. Same concept, different unit (Unity: seconds, Resonite: ms).

        // single equivalent value - the closest is `dryLevel`, an attenuation of the DRY signal in
        // millibels (mB, where 100 mB = 1 dB). At dryLevel = 0 mB the dry signal passes through at
        // full volume (implying a mostly-dry mix); as dryLevel drops toward -10000 mB the dry

        // proportion gives a reasonable, monotonic approximation:
        //   dryLevel_dB = dryLevel / 100                (millibel -> decibel)
        //   dryGainLinear = 10 ^ (dryLevel_dB / 20)      (dB -> linear amplitude)
