// some mobile targets) that needs UnityCG.cginc's DecodeLightmap() applied before the values mean
// anything as a 0..1+ linear light multiplier. Feeding the raw encoded texture straight into
// Renderite's SecondaryAlbedo slot would produce visibly wrong (washed out/inverted-looking)
// lighting in Resonite.
//
// Bakery note: this only reads LightmapSettings.lightmaps[i].lightmapColor, i.e. Bakery's
// Unity-compatible non-directional bake mode (where Bakery itself writes its result through the
// standard Unity lightmap slot). Bakery's RNM (Radiosity Normal Mapping) directional mode instead
// bakes into a separate set of custom directional textures that never touch lightmapColor, and
// those are NOT read or decoded by this pipeline - a scene baked with Bakery RNM mode will not
// get correct (or possibly any) baked lighting through this path.
