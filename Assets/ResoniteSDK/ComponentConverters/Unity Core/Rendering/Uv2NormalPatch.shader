// Used by DirectionalLightmapBaker.cs (via CommandBuffer.DrawMesh, not Graphics.Blit — this pass
// rasterizes a mesh's own triangles positioned by their LIGHTMAP UV (UV2) instead of by an actual
// camera/MVP transform, exactly the technique a lightmap/AO baker itself uses to bake data "into
// UV space"). Renders one renderer's interpolated *geometry* (vertex) world normal into every
// texel its own lightmap UV island covers, at the same texel density as its footprint in the
// shared lightmap atlas.
//
// Deliberately geometry-normal-only (reads the mesh's NORMAL vertex attribute, never samples a
// material's normal/bump map) — see DirectionalLightmapBaker.cs's header comment for why this is
// scoped as "Phase 1" only; a tangent-space normal-map version is an explicit follow-up, not
// attempted here.
//
// Built-in RP shader (uses UnityCG.cginc), same style as LightmapDecode.shader in this same
// folder. Only ever driven by CommandBuffer.DrawMesh into an offscreen RenderTexture from Editor
// tooling code — never assigned to a renderer, so URP/HDRP compatibility is not a concern.
//
// Note on Y-orientation: vert() below deliberately does NOT flip clip-space Y via
// `_ProjectionParams.x`, unlike an earlier attempt to hand-replicate Unity's automatic
// per-platform Blit-quad Y-orientation compensation. That approach is unreliable here:
// `_ProjectionParams` is populated by Unity's camera pipeline (SetupCameraProperties) for
// whichever camera is CURRENTLY rendering, and this pass has no camera at all — it's driven by
// Graphics.ExecuteCommandBuffer against an offscreen target with no SetViewProjectionMatrices
// call either — so the value read there would be leftover global shader state from whatever
// last rendered a real camera (e.g. the Scene/Game view), not something meaningfully tied to
// this render target. This is the same class of silent orientation bug DirectionalLightmapBaker.cs
// has to guard against for its own color/dir atlas readback.
//
// Instead, this pass writes its raw, UNCOMPENSATED clip-space output, and
// DirectionalLightmapBaker.RenderUv2NormalPatch routes the resulting RenderTexture through
// BlitReadableAtlas — the SAME already-proven (real-machine, luminance-correlation-verified)
// RawPassthroughBlit.shader + UnityObjectToClipPos Blit-quad readback DirectionalLightmapBaker.cs
// already uses for the directional lightmap texture — instead of a second, independent,
// unverified guess at the same correction. See RenderUv2NormalPatch's own doc comment
// (DirectionalLightmapBaker.cs) for the full reasoning.
