// Bridges Unity's baked-lightmap system (Bakery included, since it also writes its results
// through the standard renderer.lightmapIndex / lightmapScaleOffset / LightmapSettings.lightmaps
// mechanism after baking - Unity-compatible non-directional mode only, see the Bakery note on
// LightmapDecoder) into the conversion pipeline.
//
// Renderite does not support custom shaders, so we cannot ship a "lit by lightmap" shader to
// Resonite directly. Instead, when a MeshRenderer's material is Unity's Standard shader in
// Opaque mode and has a valid baked lightmap assigned, we resolve (creating on first use) a
// persisted Material *asset* using the ResoniteSDK/BakedLightmapStandard marker shader (see
// BakedLightmapStandard.shader), carrying the decoded lightmap texture + ScaleOffset as extra
// properties. BakedLightmapStandardConverter then routes that marker shader to
// PBS_MultiUV_Metallic, folding the lightmap into the SecondaryAlbedo (UV1) slot.
//
// Any material/renderer combination that doesn't meet the criteria below is returned unchanged,
// so it falls through to the regular StandardConverter (or whichever converter would otherwise
// have handled it).
//
// Design notes:
//  - Variants are real project assets living at a deterministic path under
//    Assets/ResoniteSDK/Generated/LightmapVariants/<sceneGUID>/, rather than an in-memory
//    Dictionary<CacheKey, Material> of HideFlags.DontSave clones. A DontSave-backed cache doesn't
//    survive an Editor domain reload, which would leave any AssetConversionManager converter
//    GameObject that already held a reference to a previous variant as its `Source` pointing at a
//    destroyed/missing object post-reload; it also has no on-disk identity, so two different
//    scenes converting the same source material could produce colliding names/instances. Looking
//    a variant up is just AssetDatabase.LoadAssetAtPath - if it exists, Unity gives us back the
//    *same* Material instance it always would for that path (survives domain reloads, scene
//    reopens, and separate Editor sessions), and if it doesn't exist yet we create it once with
//    AssetDatabase.CreateAsset. There is no in-memory cache to invalidate or go stale: the
//    deterministic path *is* the cache key.
//
//  - Because a cache "hit" is now just "the asset already exists", we can no longer skip copying
//    properties on a hit - if we did, edits to the source material after the first conversion
//    would never propagate. So every property listed in GetVariantOrOriginalInner is
//    unconditionally re-read from source and written to the variant on every call; a change is
//    only detected (and EditorUtility.SetDirty called) property-by-property so we're not forcing
//    a dirty/reserialize on every single frame when nothing actually changed.
//
//  - The deterministic asset name embeds the owning scene's GUID (unsaved scenes fall back to a
//    shared "unsaved" bucket - see GetSceneGuid), so the same source material baked differently
//    in two different scenes can never collide on the same variant asset.
//
//  - The ScaleOffset component of the name is a bit-exact hash of the Vector4 (see HashScaleOffset
//    / FloatBits) instead of relying on float equality/GetHashCode, so two ScaleOffsets are only
//    ever treated as identical if they're bit-for-bit the same value.
//
//  - GetVariantOrOriginal never throws: eligibility checks are defensive (including an explicit
//    HasProperty("_Mode") guard), and the entire lookup/creation body is wrapped in a try/catch
//    that logs and falls back to the original material rather than aborting the whole conversion.
//
//  - A session-scoped Dictionary<path, Material> cache (see _materialByPath below) fronts the
//    AssetDatabase.LoadAssetAtPath lookup for performance. The on-disk asset remains the actual
//    source of truth - if a domain reload clears the dictionary, the very next call just falls
//    through to LoadAssetAtPath and refills it, so correctness never depends on the dictionary
//    surviving a reload (this front-cache is deliberately NOT a replacement for the asset-backed
//    design above, only a lookup-cost optimization on top of it). GetVariantOrOriginalInner still
//    re-syncs every property on every call regardless of hit/miss - that part is unchanged and is
//    cheap (in-memory Material property writes), unlike the AssetDatabase calls this cache
//    actually saves.
//
//  - Because variant assets are named after a scene GUID + a hash of the source material +
//    ScaleOffset, deleting/renaming a scene, or a scene being re-baked with different content,
//    can leave old variant .mat/.png assets behind under
//    Assets/ResoniteSDK/Generated/LightmapVariants/<sceneGUID>/ that nothing ever re-visits or
//    deletes. There is no automatic sweep for these (doing so safely would require knowing every
//    scene GUID that has ever existed, which isn't something we can enumerate reliably) - use the
//    "Resonite SDK/Clear Generated Lightmap Variants" menu item below to nuke the entire generated
//    folder on demand; every entry in it is fully reproducible by re-running the scene conversion.
//
//  - GetVariantOrOriginalInner has an additional branch, taken only when the renderer's lightmap
//    slot was baked with a directional lightmapper (LightmapData.lightmapDir != null), that
//    substitutes a per-renderer combined texture from DirectionalLightmapBaker in place of the
//    plain shared-atlas decode - see that branch's own inline comment and
//    DirectionalLightmapBaker.cs's header comment for the full design. A non-directional bake
//    (lightmapDir == null) takes none of that code and is unaffected.
